Labeled datasets are often available or can be created\n3. The results are more predictable and interpretable\n4. There are mature tools and frameworks available\n\nHowever, unsupervised learning is gaining popularity for exploratory data analysis, and reinforcement learning is growing in specialized applications like robotics and gaming."}
